CalmingVibration – Soothe Stress with Your Apple Watch 

Discover a moment of calm with CalmingVibration, the innovative WatchOS app designed to help you manage stress. Harnessing the power of your Apple Watch’s haptic engine, CalmingVibration delivers gentle, rhythmic vibrations to promote relaxation (or focus) and restore balance, right from your wrist.

Why CalmingVibration?

Personalized Stress Relief: Using HealthKit data like Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and Resting Heart Rate (RHR), CalmingVibration intelligently detects stress levels in real-time and suggests soothing haptic sessions tailored to your needs.

Our app uses carefully crafted haptic patterns to calm your nervous system, helping you feel centred.

Seamless Integration: Fully compatible with WatchOS 10 and above, CalmingVibration taps into Apple’s HealthKit to monitor your stress indicators and provide actionable insights.
Customizable Experience: Adjust session durations, session types (will change the haptic feedback accordingly) and stress detection settings to match your preferences. 

Choose intelligent learning-derived baselines or custom thresholds for a truly personalized experience.

Real-Time Stress Monitoring: Stay informed with real-time updates on your stress levels, displayed with intuitive emojis and color-coded feedback. 

Key Features:

Haptic-Driven Relaxation: Enjoy customizable vibration patterns to ease stress, from gentle clicks to soothing success haptics.
Smart Stress Detection: Leverage HRV and RHR data to identify high or moderate stress levels and receive proactive suggestions for calming or focus sessions. After each session, connect with the Mindfulness app to track your progress and stress levels.
User-Friendly Interface: A sleek, intuitive design with a pulsating animation to guide you through sessions, plus easy access to settings for a tailored experience.

How It Works:

Monitor: CalmingVibration uses HealthKit to track your HRV and RHR, calculating your stress level based on customisable or derived baselines.
Relax/Focus: Start a session (1–5 minutes) with specific haptic feedback designed to soothe your nervous system.
Reflect: After each session, check your stress levels in the Mindfulness app to see the difference and allow your Apple Watch to re-calculate your HRV and update your RHR [Apologies, Apple (still) doesn't provide an API to trigger that calculation from the App].
